📐 Prompto Reward Engine — "PFEM" (Prompto Fair Engagement Model)

Objective

To ensure fair, transparent, and performance-driven reward distribution to influencers who promote ads on TikTok and Instagram using both on-chain and off-chain data.

Formula

TotalReward = Base × PlatformWeight × (ReachFactor + EngagementFactor + PerformanceFactor) × DurationMultiplier + Bonus

Breakdown

Factor

Definition

Base

Base rate per engagement point. Dynamically adjustable per campaign. (e.g., $0.01)

PlatformWeight

Adjusts reward based on platform influence. (e.g., TikTok = 1.2, Instagram = 1.0)

ReachFactor

log10(Followers + 1) — logarithmic normalization to avoid over-rewarding massive accounts.

EngagementFactor

Average interaction rate across posts, normalized. (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Views × 10

PerformanceFactor

Actual ad post performance. (Post Views / Followers) × CTR × 0.5

DurationMultiplier

Campaign duration booster. 1 + (Campaign Days / 30)

Bonus

Additional rewards for early sharing, verified creators, or high-quality content

Example: TikTok 15-Day Campaign

Followers: 25,000

Avg Engagement Rate: 8%

Views: 30,000

Clicks: 600 (2%)

Duration: 15 days

ReachFactor        = log10(25000) ≈ 4.40
EngagementFactor   = 0.08 × 10 = 0.8
PerformanceFactor  = (30000 / 25000) × 0.02 × 0.5 = 0.012
DurationMultiplier = 1.5
TotalReward        = 0.01 × 1.2 × (4.40 + 0.8 + 0.012) × 1.5
                   ≈ $0.094
